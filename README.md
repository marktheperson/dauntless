# Dauntless
--
The purpose of this website is to make it easier for clan members from Dauntless of Lineage 2: Revolution to get the latest clan info. The main sections are the schedule, raid groups, attendance, contributions, and prizes.

## Design

The rationale behind making a website for this purpose is to make it easier for clan members to readily access this information, which can be overwhelming at times.

The site will be a one page website which pulls data from a Google Sheets document. It will eventually have filters to allow each member to see the necessary information as a short summary. For now, it will have multiple sections which contain the information for the entire clan.

##Content

### Schedule

This section defines the most up to date schedule for the clan. Updated on a weekly basis.

### Raid Groups

This section lists each Clan Dungeon raid group and team lead.

### Attendance

This section shows the weekly attendance chart for the entire clan. It can be combined with the raid groups section.

### Contributions + DKP

This section is updated weekly and shows your total DKP. It will include base contributions, clan core buffs donated, plus DKP from raid attendance.

### Prizes

This section lists all available prizes and the minimum bid required to purchase it using DKP points.

### Purchases/Transactions

This section lists all purchases/balances for each clan member. Updated manually on the Google doc.
